# snake
My version of snake game on python. Made to practice python and just for fun. 

To run it you need to install pygame (use "pip install pygame") and then just run "runner.py" (no pun intended), everything should work fine. I used virtual environment and installed pygame there, so if you manage to activate it then the game should work without additional installation of pygame on your system.
