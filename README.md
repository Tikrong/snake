# snake
My version of snake game on python. Made to practice python and just for fun. 

First you should install pygame (pip install -r requirements.py). It's more convenient to do in in a virtual environment.
The game was testep on Python 3.10. To run it you just need to run "runner.py" (no pun intended), everything should work fine.
